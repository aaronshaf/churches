I'd like to have a better understanding of how databases work. When I run Wrangler dev, are we using a local copy of SQLite database?

Normally going forward, how should we think about database migrations? What should I do when I make migrations locally? How will I know when I need to run them for the production server?

And that's it. I don't really want a staging environment remotely. I just want my dev environment and I want production to keep it simple. 

The question is whether we are using Drizzle migrations properly, and whether going forward someone can set this up from scratch really well. Whether they can just spin it up for their own site, and whether there's any funny business with database migrations for that. 

It looks like we lost our private notes and public notes along the way. We're going to need to make sure we restore those from the Terso database. Or maybe we're not loading them correctly. But I don't see our old notes, private notes, and public notes.  Oh, wait, it actually looks like we have the notes in the database, but they're showing on the county websites, but they're not showing on the individual church pages yet.
