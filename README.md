## Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:

- `churches` - Church information including location, contacts, and status
- `counties` - Utah counties
- `affiliations` - Church networks/denominations
- `church_affiliations` - Many-to-many relationship
- `church_gatherings` - Service times and details
- `church_images` - Church photos and images
- `pages` - Static pages (FAQ, About, etc.)
- `settings` - Site configuration

## Church Status Types

- **Listed** - Publicly visible churches
- **Ready to list** - Pending review
- **Assess** - Under evaluation
- **Needs data** - Incomplete information
- **Unlisted** - Not publicly visible
- **Heretical** - Excluded from public data
- **Closed** - No longer active

## API Endpoints

- `GET /counties/:path` - Churches in a specific county
- `GET /churches/:path` - Individual church details
- `GET /map` - Interactive map
- `GET /networks` - Church affiliations
- `GET /data` - Data export page

### Data Export

## Key Features for Administrators

### Save and Continue Workflow
When editing churches, administrators can use the "Save and continue" button to:
1. Save the current church
2. Automatically navigate to the next church needing review (oldest update date)
3. Continue reviewing churches in sequence without returning to the list

### Efficient Data Entry
- Drag-and-drop image reordering
- Automatic address formatting and normalization
- Service time validation and normalization
- AI extraction for rapid data collection from church websites

## AI-Powered Data Extraction

The application includes an AI-powered feature to automatically extract church information from websites:

### How it Works
1. Enter a church website URL in the edit form
2. Click "Extract Info from Website"
3. The system fetches and converts the webpage to text
4. Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite (via OpenRouter) analyzes the content
5. Extracted data is automatically filled into the form

### Extracted Information
- Phone numbers (formatted consistently)
- Email addresses
- Physical addresses (with proper capitalization)
- Service times with:
  - Normalized time formats (e.g., "9 AM" not "9am")
  - Day of week for multi-day schedules
  - Brief notes (2-4 words max like "Traditional" or "Bible study")
- Social media links (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Spotify)
- Statement of Faith URL

### Setup
1. Sign up for a free [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) account
2. Generate an API key
3. Add to `.dev.vars` and production secrets

The extraction uses Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite which has a 1M+ token context window, allowing it to process even very large church websites.

## Authentication Setup

### Clerk Configuration

The application uses [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for authentication with role-based access control.

1. **Create a Clerk Application**
   - Sign up at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
   - Create a new application
   - Copy your API keys

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Development keys (required)
   CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   ```

3. **Set User Roles**
   - The application uses `publicMetadata` for role-based access control
   - Available roles: `admin`, `contributor`, `user`
   - First user can be promoted to admin using:
   ```bash
   pnpm tsx scripts/set-clerk-admin.ts user@example.com
   ```

4. **Production Setup**
   ```bash
   # Set production secrets
   wrangler secret put CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
   wrangler secret put CLERK_SECRET_KEY
   ```


## Deployment

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

```bash
# Set production secrets
wrangler secret put TURSO_DATABASE_URL
wrangler secret put TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN
wrangler secret put GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID
wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_HASH
wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_API_TOKEN
wrangler secret put OPENROUTER_API_KEY
wrangler secret put CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
wrangler secret put CLERK_SECRET_KEY
wrangler secret put USE_CLERK_AUTH
