# URGENT: Production Database Fix

## Problem
The production database is missing the `church_images` table, causing 500 errors on:
- Church detail pages (e.g., /churches/art-city-church)
- Admin edit pages (e.g., /admin/churches/259/edit)

## Solution Applied
I've added comprehensive error handling to allow the site to function without the church_images table. The site should now be working.

## To Enable Image Features
Run the following command to create the church_images table in production:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute utahchurches-production --file=drizzle/0008_add_church_images_table.sql
```

Or use the provided script:
```bash
./scripts/apply-church-images-migration.sh
```

## Status
- ✅ Error handling added to all church_images operations
- ✅ Site should be functional now
- ⏳ church_images table needs to be created for image features to work

## Files Modified
1. `src/routes/church-detail.tsx` - Added error handling for public church pages
2. `src/routes/admin/churches.tsx` - Added error handling for admin operations

The site should now be working properly even without the church_images table!
